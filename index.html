					<p>The probability of passing the next tournament stage varies widely between countries and within the same country over time. This D3-graph allows individuals to select any country with at least one World Cup appearance and shows the probability for that specific team of passing onto the next round for every year of participation. We could detect some typical types of participants. Brazil, Uruguay, Mexico, and Argentina have a cyclical probability of passing the next rounds over time. Germany, by contrast, has been improving its chances of going further in the competition. Finally, the United States only seems to have started participating in the tournament in recent years and has yet to achieve notable success on the international-level in the World Cup. We invite users to explore this data to identify any other interesting patterns for the nations of particular interest to them. </p>
